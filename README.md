# 🐣 Twitter Clone with Phoenix LiveView

> This project is simply an example project for the CoderCamp week @ CoderDojo Braga

## 📚 TODO (for a week)

- [ ] Create a new project
- [ ] Simple posts CRUD with twitter-like feed (title, body, username, timestamps)
- [ ] Realtime search bar (based on the post title)
- [ ] Users and authentication (check the generator)
- [ ] Associate a post with an user (username transforms into an user_id)
- [ ] Add likes to posts (with proper constraints)
- [ ] Add reposts to posts (no need for actual reposts, just a counter)

## 🚀 Future work (for the rest of the summer)

- [ ] Add comments to posts
- [ ] Realtime likes, reposts, comments and post creation (PubSub)
- [ ] Add user profile (with name, age, bio, profile picture, etc)
- [ ] Add user following (with proper feed filtering)
- [ ] Add user notifications (likes, reposts, comments, follows)
- [ ] Add user mentions in posts and comments
